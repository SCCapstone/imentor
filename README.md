### MAST - mentoring app for students and teachers

Welcome to iMentor! Our client is VC3 and the Richland 2 School District. They've requested a web app that expands a program that is currently in place,
a teacher supervises a student and a community member on a project that appeals to a student's area of interest and the community members area
of expertise. The current problem is mentors must travel to meet with the students and sometimes the travel time is longer than the actual meeting 
time. On top of that, it would be nice to get more mentors involved with these projects but time and travel constraints make this limited. 
Our app is aimed to address this problem.

Here's a brief overview of what we have set out to accomplish:

*Create a page that displays a list of projects that currently need a mentor. This is like a job listing page
*The listing needs to have details, subject areas, an indication if there is still a need for this project to have a mentor and a scheduling mechanism
*The app must use google technologies as this integrates with a platform students are already familiar with
*The app should be simple and streamlined for ease of use 
*Mentors must be able to apply to listings, the teacher must be able to approve
*Admin is an account to help troubleshoot possible issues on the teachers end from a remote location
*Google hangouts must work as the video chat platform to address the distance issue. It should also return a url to our app so mentors and students can access the same hangout
*The different account levels are differentiated by level of accesss. A student or mentor account should not be able to edit listings.
